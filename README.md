## Inspiration
StudySpace was inspired by the need for a dynamic and engaging study environment that goes beyond traditional methods. We wanted to create a platform that not only facilitates focused learning but also injects an element of fun and collaboration (especially in our distraction-centric world !!!).

## What it does
StudySpace is a social study Pomodoro app. It integrates the Pomodoro technique for effective study sessions and features entertaining space-themed mini-games during the breaks. Collect coins to show off to your friends and customize your home page. The app also fosters a community of learners AND friends, allowing users to connect, collaborate, and share their learning journeys.

## How we built it
StudySpace was build using Unity and c# mainly. It integrated techniques that created the avatars and textures within the game too, mostly related to low-poly.

## Challenges we ran into
Building StudySpace posed several challenges, including synchronizing the Pomodoro timer with the mini-games, ensuring a smooth user experience. Overcoming these challenges required a combination of innovative problem-solving and collaborative efforts from everyone.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're all proud of how much we learned throughout this process and the progress we made!

## What we learned
We learned how to critically think to create new ideas as well as merge our own. We found ways to incorporate everyone into the project as an efficient team.

## What's next for StudySpace
More games, more customization, more friends!!!
